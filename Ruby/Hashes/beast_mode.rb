# Ruby Hashes Beast Mode ++


# Beast Mode ++
# Create a ruby application that requests the name of a classmate, and displays their birthday and your birthday. Use at least one Hash and one Array in the solution.
# Bonus:
# 1. Display the number of days between your birthdays.
# 1. Create a method to display their star sign based on their birthday.
# 2. Someone's probably already coded this date to star sign functionality - replace your method with a gem

my_birthday = 23091985

# Ask user for their birthday & introduce myself
puts "What is your name?"
name = gets.chomp
puts "Hello #{name}, my name is Katie"

# Ask user for birthday & tell them mine
puts "When's your birthday, buddy?"
birthday = gets.chomp
puts "So your, birthday is #{birthday}, huh? Interesting, my birthday is #{my_birthday}"


# my birthday is this many days away from yours

# one hash and one array
